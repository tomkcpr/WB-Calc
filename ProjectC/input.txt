 Weight Scale Simulator gives strong and simple flexibility over electronics components settings e.g. maximum level of power, system output, 2 or 4 gages system etc.  Program has two panels to control and manipulate data: Wheatstone Bridge Panel and Calculations Panel. First, take a quick look at Wheatstone Bridge circuit picture by clicking on Calculations Panel tab to get an idea of how labels are organized. To set the values of the circuit, the Wheatstone Bridge Panel should be used. The first group of the panel is 2 or 4 gages system. Either 2 or 4 gage radio button can be checked. 2 gages system mean: R4 is an active strain gage and R3 is a dummy gage that is being used for a temprature balance. The second group of the panel is Resistance, Max load cell, max power level and step specification. By clicking on Gage Resistance break down box, user have a choice of three most commonly used resistances for each resistor in Wheatstone Bridge Circuit: 120, 350 and 1000 Ohms. The next item is Load(lb), by entering value ranging from 25 to 10,000 pounds, user sets the maximum load cell at which the gage will get to its maximum strain level of 2.5%. Power text field allows user to specify the gage power limitations. The last item of this group is Step that gives user a flexibility of specifying a number of points of calculations that will be displayed in table. 4 points will be displayed if 25 is entered with maximum weight of 100 pounds, it means that the table will display every 25th pound of calculations. Bridge Voltage IN DC slider allows user to only specify the voltage to not exceed the power limitations. The Amplifier Max Voltage OUT DC slider allows user to select the System Output at the maximum load cell. The values range from 1 to 5 volts. All the fields in Wheatstone Bridge Panel are being checked dynamically, it means that if user prompted bad value, he won't be able to switch to the next field.
