 In 1843 the English physicist Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802-1875) found a bridge circuit for the measurement of electrical resistances.This Bridge Circuit, known today as the Wheatstone bridge, is an electrical circuit, shown in figure above, that is commonly used to determine the change in resistance that a strain gage(R4 for 2 gages system or R4 and R2 for 4 gages system in our circuit) experiences when it is subjected to a strain.       The Wheatstone Bridge circuit considered here is excited with a fixed voltage ( regardless of gage current) because this is what is commonly used in the commercial instrumentation, called strain indicator. The Wheatstone bridge can be used both for static and dynamic strain gage readings. In the static environment, the bridge can be used as a null-balance meter where the output voltage is adjusted to a zero value by adjusting the resistive balance of the bridge. In the dynamic environment, the bridge   can be   used  as a  direct-readout device, where the  output voltage is measured and related to strain. Strain gauge resistance is sensitive to temperature variation. Therefore, if the temperature aries during testing, the strain readings would be in error unless the temperature variation is taken into account. The simplest way is to use a dummy gauge in the bridge which does not experience strain aplied to it. Dummy Gage is R3 for 2 gages system or R3 and R1 for 4 gages system in Wheatstone Bridge Simulator.
